# Mathematics-everywhere

This repository documents my English-based learning experience in the course **"Matematiikkaa kaikkialla"** (Mathematics Everywhere) from the University of Helsinki Open University.

Though the course content is in Finnish, I completed all tasks by translating and studying the material in English. This repository serves both as:

- A personal academic record
- Proof of English study for university applications
